# YaleSchoolOfArt-
Yale School of Art Website Revamp
In this project, we took the original Yale School of Art website, which had a dated and unappealing design, and completely revamped it to create a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience. Our goal was to improve the overall aesthetics, enhance the navigation, and make the website more accessible for users. We focused on a clean and minimal design with responsive features, ensuring that the site looks great on all devices.

Key improvements include:
- A fresh, modern color palette
- Streamlined navigation and content layout
- Optimized mobile responsiveness
- User-centered design improvements
